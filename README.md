# homework
home work from various classes mainly csci 1300 and data structures.
for the rest of my classes they will all have their own repe (unless the univiersity asks me to keep the repo private) for all future computer nerds of CU boulder, I hope that these programs help you guys figure out your homework and feel free to use any of this a refrence, but please do not copy paste.
